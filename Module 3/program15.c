/*A Credit Card number is usually a 16-digit number. A valid Credit Card number would satisfy a rule explained below with the help of a
dummy Credit Card numberâ€”4567 1234 5678 9129. Start with the leftmost digit and multiply every other digit by 2.
4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 9

8 12 2 6 10 14 18 4
From above array, Then subtract 9 from any number larger than or equal to 10. 
Thus we get:
8 3 2 6 1 5 9 4
Add above all to get 38.
Add all the other digits in the original credit card number which you didn't multiply by 2 to get 42.

Sum of 38 and 42 is 80. Since 80 is divisible by 10, the Credit Card number is valid.

Write a program that receives a Credit Card number and checks using the above rule whether the Credit Card number is valid.

Input Format: Read credit card number without spaces.

Test cases:
case=t1
input=4567123456789129
output=
Credit Card Number is valid
